    "# 1.Guassian distribution\n",
    "    Gussian distribution is also called normal distribution,is a probability distribution which is symmetric about mean.showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.It fits many natural phenomena, for example, heights, blood pressure, measurement error, and IQ scores.\n",
    "    The normal distribution is a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is a symmetric distribution where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions. Extreme values in both tails of the distribution are similarly unlikely.As with any probability distribution, the parameters for the normal distribution define its shape and probabilities entirely. The normal distribution has two parameters, the mean and standard deviation. The normal distribution does not have just one form. Instead, the shape changes based on the parameter values."

    "Standard deviation:-The standard deviation is a measure of variability. It defines the width of the normal distribution. The standard deviation determines how far away from the mean the values tend to fall. It represents the typical distance between the observations and the average.On a graph, changing the standard deviation either tightens or spreads out the width of the distribution along the X-axis. Larger standard deviations produce distributions that are more spread out."

    "# 2.Binomial distribution\n",
    "    The binomial distribution is a common discrete distribution used in statistics, as opposed to a continuous distribution, such as the normal distribution. This is because the binomial distribution only counts two states, typically represented as 1 (for a success) or 0 (for a failure) given a number of trials in the data. The binomial distribution, therefore, represents the probability for x successes in n trials, given a success probability p for each trial.The binomial distribution is often used in social science statistics as a building block for models for dichotomous outcome variables, like whether a Republican or Democrat will win an upcoming election or whether an individual will die within a specified period of time, etc.\n"
